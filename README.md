About me
--------

I am a software developer who likes to use technology as a tool to deal with our current society/businesses needs. I truly believe in finding simple and elegant solutions for complex problems.

Currently I spend most of my time as a full-stack developer building and maintaining web-applications. But during my free time I tend to focus on different programming areas like embedded controllers and mobile application development. I feel that having developed a broader knowledge helps me on finding quicker and better solutions for the common challenges that I encounter on a daily basis.


Education
---------
- 2006 - 2009 · **Level 3 degree (ISCED classification) in Computer and Networking Administration** - EPMS Viseu

- 2009 - 2011 · **Master's Degree in Network and Information Systems Engineering** *(unfinished)* - University of Porto

- 2011 - 2015 · **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** - Instituto Politécnico de Viseu

I've grown fascinated with computers and electronics in general. Started at 5 when I started to disassemble all my toys (and usually failing to put them back together). But later at 9 my "disassembling skills" got more a bit more useful when I would spend full afternoons removing electronic components from old devices, so they could later be used to repair other equipment.

But was only at 16, during my vocational education, that I discovered my passion for programming. From that point a decided to switch my focus from mainly electronics and communications to software development. I felt programming was this big hidden universe that the more you learn the further you realize out how little you know about it. That keeps me exploring more of it and never felling like stopping.


Working experience
------------------

- May 2018 · **Lead developer** - Clutch, Amsterdam

	I am currently responsible for maintaining and improving the websites of our current clients. I'm also focused on the training process of new developers so can they can catch up quicker and be more independent.

	Lately I've been more involved on defining stable and efficient strategy to unify our technology stack and create a stricter process of approach for our future projects. 
	
- March 2015 - May 2018 · **Backend developer** - Strangelove, Amsterdam

	After finishing my formal education I joined a small agency in Amsterdam. It started as a short Erasmus programme internship but after 3 months I decided to stay.

	During my time there I maintained and helped to improve an in-house CMS (largely written in PHP) which was later joined by a front-end framework written from scratch in javascript, using React as a rendering library. That tools were used to build most of our clients websites.

	In later stages in addition to my previous responsibilities I was also in control of maintaining some hosting infrastructure and helping with the on-boarding and training of new developers.

Technical experience and technologies
----------------------------------------

#####Main technologies (high proficiency):

```
- Node.js (with Express)
- Python (with Django)
- MongoDB
- SQL (MariaDB, Postgres)
- React.js
- Redux + React router

```

#####Other technologies:

```
 - PHP (Laravel)
 - Docker and Docker compose
 - Capistrano (application deployments)
 - Unit testing (Jest)
 - HTML/CSS (using tools like SASS, Styled Components, etc)
```

Currently I focus on building web applications using React.js (with Typescript) on the frontend and either Python or javascript on the backend part. But I have a broad skillset that includes but not limited to some experience with system administration (unix), networking and mobile application development.

I believe that no developer should be tied to a specific technology, instead it should adapt and choose the best tools that can create the most stable and effective solutions.
